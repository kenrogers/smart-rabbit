      Most waiting rooms suck. Clients get a few old magazines, some bad coffee, lukewarm water, and sit there mind-numbingly bored while they wait for their appointment.

      
      You don’t have to sentence your clients to waiting room hell every time they come in for an appointment.

      I’m Dionne Rogers. For as long as I can remember I’ve loved baking. For myself, friends, family, anyone who wants to eat, I’m ready to bake them something delicious.


      Like all of us, I’m no fan of sitting around in waiting rooms. So I decided to use my love of baking to help business owners delight their customers with made-from-scratch baked goods that will keep your clients happy and coming back for me, even if they have to wait.
